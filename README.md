Access Code Generating Web App
This Web App seeks to solve the problem of unauthorized visitors and entries into major estates and restricted areas. 
Unauthorised access into major residential estates is a major issue that can be a bridge to the insecurity of lives and properties. The alternate solution currently out there involve the use of traditional(book)entry records and mobile phone calls for unauthorized access verification either by the check-in persons or security personnel. Also considering an estate with more than 100 residents, time wastage, queuing, and congestion at most estate security check-in post, for both pedestrians and vehicles is a major challenge.

The application will enable client residents to create and send access code to their visitors. Visitors present or key-in the access code at the security check point for verification. Based on IoT, the advent of big data technologies, the cloud and mobile app first principle, This web app is solely dedicated to creating customised and innovative enterprise access control solutions that will facilitate the security of lives and properties. All processes will be in compliant with international and national security regulation standards.

The access control application comes with two user functions, the Client user and the access
code authentication.
The client user has the registration and login.
The client resident are expected to register via the app with a secret unique resident code or key and their verified details which include their first name, surname, email address, phone number, street number, street name and estate name.
The resident is expected to login with his or her registered username and password to enable him/her in generating the one-time access code and share it via SMS, WhatssAp or email to their visitors. The resident login and provides the following visitors details: 
first and second name, visit duration, expected time of arrival, number of persons, generate code or cancel access code.
The access code is expected to last for stipulated registered date(duration)as selected by the resident. 
The resident can also login to cancel or revoke the visitors access privilege.
